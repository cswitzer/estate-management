1. Setting up an optimized Dockerfile containing multistage builds
2. Creating and using an entrypoint so the Dockerfile can setup postgres before running the command from docker compose
3. Creating docker compose file to manage relationships, networks, and volumes between multiple containers
4. Creating volumes to map changes from my local filesystem to the one in the container
5. Using volumes to persist db data in my postgres container and mailpit container so that data is preserved when stopping containers
6. Praise Docker because I don't have to download postgres, mailpit, etc. to my own computer!

1. Using yasg to generate automatic redoc documentation for all my API endpoints
2. It is best practice to setup a custom user manager to add fields we think are important for the user class
3. We need to modify the UserChangeForm and UserCreationForm to account for new fields we added to user class
4. Difference between AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser
   - AbstractUser -> Includes base functionality of the default Django User model like username, first_name, last_name, email, is_staff, is_superuser, and date_joined. Much easier to extend but provides less flexibility
   - AbstractBaseUser -> Provides only core authentication functionality like password and last login without username and email. Harder to extend but provides much more flexibility
5. How to create custom user model, specifying required fields and the username field
6. Creating a custom user admin class using (BaseUserAdmin), specifying which fields the add and edit forms have
